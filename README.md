AI-Based Assignment Analytics & Intelligent Feedback System for Teachers

This project is a teacher-focused analytics system that automatically analyzes student assignment submissions and generates structured, editable feedback. Instead of only grading answers, the system identifies common mistakes, detects conceptual gaps, and summarizes performance trends across the class.

Teachers can upload student responses (CSV/JSON/Excel), and the system groups answers by question, extracts patterns using AI, and generates class-level and question-wise insights. It also provides draft feedback that teachers can review, edit, approve, or reject before sharing.




This project is built using the Flask framework.  
To start the application locally, run the file using the command: "python app.py" in the command prompt.
